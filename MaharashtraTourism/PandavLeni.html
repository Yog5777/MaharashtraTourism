<br><p>BUDDHA VIHAR, PATHARDI PHATA, NASHIK, MAHARASHTRA 422010

                  A 2000 year old, group of 24 caves in one of the holiest Hindu cities of the country. The Kumbh Mela is held here once in 12 years along with Ujjain, Allahabad and Haridwar. Also, known as Trirashmi caves, these were carved between 3rd century BC and the 2nd century AD. These caves depict tales of the three Kings who once ruled Nashik – the Kshatrapas, the Satavahanas and the Abhirs. All the caves face eastwards hence early morning visit is recommended as the sunlight directly falls on the beautiful carvings.</p>

                            <br><p>Out of the twenty-four caves, there are two caves which are the major centre of attraction – the main cave called the Chaitya, meaning a prayer hall, has a beautiful Stupa inside. The second one is the tenth cave which is complete in terms of structure as well in inscriptions. Caves are located midway up the Trirashmi Hill (100 m above) and is approachable by steps (staircases). Some of the caves are also interconnected by stone cut ladders.</p>

                <br><b> History of Pandavleni Caves </b>
    <br><p>The caves have served as home to many prominent and renowned Jain saints, including Ambika Devi, Tirthankara Vrishabdeo, and Veer Manibhadraji.</p>

<br><p>The Pandavleni Caves were initially known as Pundru, which means 'yellow ochre colour' in Pali language. This is because the caves served as the residence of Buddhist monks who wore the 'chivara' or yellow robes. These alluring caves were used to provide space for carrying out meditation and for living suitably and peacefully. The name of the caves - Pandavleni- has no reference and no connection to the Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. Some water tanks, which are built inside the rocks, served as places where meetings were held amongst the disciples. They also comprise of numerous sculptures of Bodhisattvas and Lord Buddha.</p>

<br><p>Later on, the word 'Pundru' was changed to Pandu Caves. The various inscriptions in the beguiling cave are an essential source of relevant historical information. They bear testimony to the fact that Nashik in that period was ruled by three dynasties in all - the Western Kshatrapas, the Satavahanas and the Abhiras. The inscriptions also confirm that apart from the kings, local merchants and landlords also supported Buddhism and donated large amounts of money for the development of the Pandavleni Caves. Decades later, people started calling these caves as the Pandav Caves, and they continue to be recognised by this name till date, even though the name is a misnomer.</p>
