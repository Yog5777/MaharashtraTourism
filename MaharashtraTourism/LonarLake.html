                  <tr><td><br><b>About Lonar Lake</b>
                      <br><p>Lonar Lake, also known as Lonar crater, is a notified National Geo-heritage Monument, saline, soda lake, located at Lonar in Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India. Lonar Lake was created by a meteorite collision impact during the Pleistocene Epoch. It is one of the four known, hyper-velocity, impact craters in basaltic rock anywhere on Earth. The other three basaltic impact structures are in southern Brazil. Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of 1.2 kilometres (3,900 ft) and is about 137 metres (449 ft) below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8 kilometres (5,900 ft) in diameter.
                      Lonar Crater sits inside the Deccan Plateau – a massive plain of volcanic basalt rock created by eruptions some 65 million years ago. Its location in this basalt field suggested to some geologists that it was a volcanic crater. Today, however, Lonar Crater is understood to be the result of a meteorite impact.The water in the lake is both saline and alkaline.</p>

 <br><p>Geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, naturalists and astronomers have published studies of various aspects of this crater lake ecosystem.

Although the crater's age was previously estimated to be 52,000 ± 6,000 years, newer studies suggest an age of 576,000 ± 47,000 years.</p>

<br><p>The Smithsonian Institution, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Survey of India, the University of Sagar and the Physical Research Laboratory have conducted extensive studies of the site. Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered in this lake in 2007.</p>

<br><p>A 2019 study, conducted by IIT Bombay found that the minerals in the lake soil are very similar to the minerals found in moon rocks brought back during the Apollo Program.The lake was declared a protected Ramsar site in November 2020.</p>
                     <br><b> History</b>
<br><p>The lake was first mentioned in ancient scriptures such as the Skanda Purana and the Padma Purana.[citation needed]

The Ain-i-Akbari, a document written about 1600 CE, states:</p>

<br><p>These mountains produce all the requisites for making glass and soap. And here are saltpetre works which yield a considerable revenue to the State, from the duties collected. On these mountains is a spring of salt water, but the water from the centre and the edges is perfectly fresh.</p>

<br><p>The first European to visit the lake was a British officer, J.E. Alexander, in 1823.[citation needed]

Buldhana district in Maharashtra, where the lake is located, was once part of the Maurya Empire and then part of the Satavahana Empire. The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas also ruled this area. During the period of the Mughals, Yadavas, Nizam, and the British, trade prospered in this area. Several temples found on the periphery of the Lake are known as Yadava temples and also as Hemadpanti temples (named after Hemadri Ramgaya).</p>
               <br><b>Geographical features</b>	

<br><p>View of the crater from the edge. A temple is visible in the forest underneath.
A series of small hills surround the basin, which has an oval shape, almost round, with a circumference at top of about 8 km (five miles). The sides of the basin rise abruptly at an angle of about 75°. At the base of the sides, the lake has a circumference of about 4.8 km (three miles). The slopes are covered with tree-savannah, housing teak (Tectona grandis), Wrightia tinctoria, Butea monosperma, and Helicteres isora, and with shrub-savannah housing Acacia nilotica and Ziziphus spp.. Along the lake shore, non-native Prosopis juliflora is spreading.[18] Millet, maize, okra, banana, and papaya are the main cultivated crops.</p>

<br><p>The water of the lake contains various salts and sodas. During dry weather, when evaporation reduces the water level, large quantities of soda are collected. Two small streams, named Purna and Penganga,[19] drain into the lake, and a well of fresh water is located on the southern side, close to the water's edge.</p>
                      <br><b>Threats to Lonar lake</b>	
<br><p>Lonar lake faces anthropological and environmental problems as listed below:

Use of fertilizers, pesticides and toxic materials in the agriculture field around the lake results in pollution of lake water.[62]
"Dhara", and "Sita Nahani" are perennial streams that are one of the water sources for the lake. They are used for bathing, washing clothes and cattle, and other domestic purposes by the local people, pilgrims, and tourists. The household effluents containing detergents are regularly disposed of here.</p>
<br><p>Deforestation is illegally[citation needed] carried out in the surroundings and cattle grazing inside or near the rim of the crater creates fecal pollution.
Excavation activities are often carried out illegally thus disturbing the lake's underground water source.
The government is unable to raise funds needed for preserving this crater and often tourist activities continue to cause environmental damage to nearby land.</p>
<br><p>During local festivals such as the Kamala Devi festival, large numbers of pilgrims enter the crater. Small shops and food-stalls are often established near the crater or along its rim.</p>
<br><p>DAmong the frequent visitors are the religious visitors from nearby towns and villages who are not adequately educated by the means of signboards and attending officials about littering and maintaining the beauty of this nationally important destination.
The lake's ecosystem is being damaged because of the sewage dump in the lake.[64] Marauding pilgrims and increasing pollution is disturbing its substantial flora and fauna with about 100 resident and migratory birds.</p>
<br><p>Commercial activities, including illegal construction, within the vicinity of lake has damaged the lake's natural topography.[66]
According to a research done in 2017, the lead researcher stated "The study found out that reduction in water level is a combined result of drying up of (nearby) percolation dam and the closure of streams (which flow) into the lake."[67]
The crater is protected as a geological landmark and authorities have recognized the role of the historical and archaeological heritage in the lake, nevertheless action is needed to prevent the adverse impact of settlements and religious festivities on the local ecosystem. Various civic activities (e.g. "Save Lonar") for the protection of Lonar crater are on-going.</p>
