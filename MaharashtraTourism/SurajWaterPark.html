<br><p>Suraj Water Park is rather convenient to get to, as compared to most of its counterparts in Mumbai which are located in rather obscure areas. Since you’ll only be spending a day at this water park, choose your mode of transport carefully, so you don’t tire yourself on the commute:</p>

<br><b><P>By Air: <br>If you’re travelling from a city that is far from Mumbai, you can fly into the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, which is the international terminal that also services many domestic flights. The other airport is the domestic one, purely reserved for some domestic airlines. The distance from either airport to Suraj Water Park is almost 30 km, requiring at least an hour to reach.</P>

<br><b><p>By Train: <br>Mumbai is very well connected to other cities and even intra-city through rail lines. The railway station closest to the water park is Thane Railway Station. Apart from servicing long distance trains, the station falls in the local train route for the Central Line. Suraj Water Park is about 10 km from the Thane Railway Station, and the commute barely takes 15 minutes. Local train travel works in your favour if you are travelling in the UP direction (CSMT to Thane) as most commuters take the other direction for their daily work commute.</p>

<br><b><p>By Bus:<br> Waghbil Naka Bus Stop is the nearest bus stop to the water park, only a few seconds of walk away. Bus travel is one of the cheapest modes of transportation in the city of Mumbai (after local trains). The state-run B.E.S.T buses are red in colour, and come in different sizes. The most common ones have been running since the era of British Rule in the previous century. There are other air-conditioned varieties, smaller buses and even Tempo Travellers which have been redesigned to increase the fleet. Many buses also come with closed circuit television surveillance for enhanced safety.</p>

<br><b><p>By Car:<br> For the ultimate enjoyment experience, especially in the sweltering summers of Mumbai, the most ideal way to get to Suraj Water Park is in a pre-booked cab from top car rental companies in Mumbai. When you don’t have to worry about navigating through the traffic of the city, it becomes easier to enjoy the rides at the water park. If you have a car with you, you can also drive all by yourself. If you’re from another city, without your own car, you can try renting a self-drive vehicle.</p>
