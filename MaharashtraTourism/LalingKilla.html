                  <tr><td><br><b>About Laling Killa </b>
                      <br><p>Laling Killa (Marathi: लळिंग किल्ला) is a small fort (killa) situated in the present day Dhule district of Maharashtra state in India. The fort is situated on top of Laling hill about 9.65 km (6.00 mi) south of Dhule city. It was one of the important forts in the Khandesh region during the time of the Faruqi Kings.</p>
                      <br><b>History</b>
<br><p>It is a place of considerable antiquity and the fort is supposed to have been built during the reign of the first of the Faruqi Kings. The fact that this fort and not that of Thalner was granted by Malik Raja (1370-1399) to his eldest son would show that Laling was his chief fort. It was in this fort that Nasir Khan and his son Miran Adil Khan were besieged in 1437 by the Bahamani general till they were relieved by an army advancing from Gujarat. Early in the seventeenth century it is mentioned more than once in connection with the movements of the Mughal troop's Deccan campaigns [Ellior, VII, 35, 102.]. In 1862, the fort is described, as strongly situated with very few defences left. This fort was on the historical Surat-Burhanpur commercial road</p>

                      <br><p>.The Laling Fort is situated south of Dhule city in Maharashtra and falls on the ancient Surat-Burhanpur trade route. It is in utter dilapidation and almost lies in ruins due to negligence and lack of maintenance attention. It has borne the brunt of many climatic atrocities apart from bearing the impact of military attacks through generations of time and utter carelessness in its caretaking has resulted in the beautiful fortification succumbing to the test of time. It houses theremnants of some rock cut cisterns that were functional at some point of time along with ruins of weaponry that were used for its protection and surveillance. Apart from its historic significance the Laling fort also provides the right platform for the best views of the city and human settlement below it. The escape getaway tract is standing to the south of the citadel where an entrance leads to dam, which is semi-circular in shape, with a shade called Chatrilocated proximally.</p>
               <br><b>How to reach</b>	
                      <br><p>The Laling Area is part of Dhule city, and it is located 16 km Western from the Dhule CBS on a busy Mumbai-Agra NH3 Highway. The path from the old hemadpanti temple in the base village leads to the fort. After climbing halfway there are steps to climb up the fort.The climbing is very easy and gentle.</p>
