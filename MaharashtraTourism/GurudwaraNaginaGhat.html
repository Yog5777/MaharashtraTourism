                  <tr><td><br><b>ABOUT GURUDWARA NAGINA GHAT SAHIB</b>
<br><p>This is an historical gurudwara on the bank of godavari river in nanded; There are many historical gurudwaraâ€™s in this region.
                      Gurudwara Nagina Ghat Sahib stands on a high plinth comprising a square hall in which Guru Granth Sahib is seated on a canopied palaki of white marble, and a smaller square room topped by a dome on the first floor.</p>

                      <br><p>It was constructed by Raja Gulab Singh Sethi of Delhi and was completed by his widow in 1968.</p>

                      <br><p>This is situated on the left bank of the Godavari and at a distance of about half mile from Takht Sachkhand Sahib.</p>
                      <br><b>HISTORY OF GURUDWARA NAGINA GHAT SAHIB</b>

                      <br><p>The story is that one-day Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji was sitting on the bank of the river when one devotee came for Darshan and presented a valuable Nagina (Pearl), which Guru Ji threw into the Godavari.</p>

                      <br><p>At this the visitor was very much upset and was sad that the Guru has failed to evaluate his present and has thrown the same in the river just like a stone.</p>

<br><p>To remove his astonishment, Guru Sahib told him to take out his Nagina from the river if that was so valuable.
                      It is said that when he entered the river, to his surprise, the river was full of pearls all around.</p>

<br><p>His false pride of worldly things was thus nullified in a much-refined way by the Guru.
                      I recommend visiting Gurudwara Nagina Ghat Sahib to attain your dose of spiritual bliss.</p>
