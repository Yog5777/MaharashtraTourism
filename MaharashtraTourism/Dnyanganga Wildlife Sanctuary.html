                      <br><b>Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary</b>
 <br><p>The Dnyanganga Sanctuary is situated in the Buldhana district of Maharashtra.
It is a part of the Melghat Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.
t is located near the Dnyanganga River which is a tributary of the Tapti River.</p>

   <br><b>Tipeshwar Tiger Reserve</b>
<br><p>It is located in Yawatmal district of Maharashtra.
The rivers such as Purna, Krishna, Bhima, and Tapti flow through the sanctuary.
                      Due to the presence of a sufficient quantity of water, it is also popularly known as Green Oasis of Maharashtra.</p>

<br><p>Tiger’s 1,300-km walk over six months strains population theory
                      Wildlife scientists and managers generally follow the popular “source and sink” population theory of a decade ago — it was believed that beyond the protected core tiger areas or source populations, a dispersing tiger population was bound to be a “sink” population, or not guaranteed to survive.</p>
<br><p>In what may be the longest trek by a tiger in India, a sub-adult of the species reached Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary in Buldhana district of Maharashtra on Sunday, walking 1,300 km over six months, from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal district.
                      What intrigues conservationists is that T1C1 appears to not have stopped anywhere for more than four-five days, and that too only when he made a kill, mostly of cattle. Maharashtra Chief Wildlife Warden Nitin Kakodkar said the tiger didn’t travel in a linear fashion but moved back and fourth several times, over farmlands, water bodies and highways, thus adding hundreds of kilometres to its journey.</p>

                      <br><p>However, T1C1’s journey, as well as growing tiger numbers in non-protected forests like Brahmapuri in Chandrapur district, shows a rethink may be needed. Bilal Habib, senior biologist with the Wildlife Institute of India, said this is the longest a tiger is known to have walked anywhere in India. “We know this because T1C1 is radio-collared,” Habib pointed out, adding, “It’s clear that with shrinking space, we need to redraft policy to ensure safety of tigers like T1C1.”</p>
