                  <tr><td><br><b>About Ramshej Fort Nashik,</b>
<br><p>India blessed with some excellent legacy forts, and Various citadels are crisscrossing all through the region's length and expansiveness. Ramshej hill fort is one such stronghold. Found 14 kilometers north-west of Nashik, on the Nashik-Vapi road, in the Peth mountain ranges, Ramshej Fort Nashik is one of the well-known monsoon treks in Maharashtra. Ramshejgad gets its name from the conviction that Lord Rama had made this spot as his living arrangement for quite a while during their exile. Ramshej means Lord Ram's bedstead. On the western tip of the lovely Ramshej Ghat in Northern Nasik, views the brilliant Ramshej Fort. Ramshej Killa is situated at a stature of 3273 feet above the sea level, which shows you the wonder of work and exertion that went into making it.</p>

<br><p>Ramshej Killa history, after the demise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, numerous forts set up substantial barriers under the authority of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. This small fortress was no exemption. Aurangzeb's military assaulted the post, and his leaders threatened the Maratha realm saying that they would catch the stronghold in hours. Yet, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and his army opposed these assaults for seven years. In this manner, the Fort stayed with the Marathas for a period that was longer than the battling lives of the leaders of Aurangazeb's military. This Courage is the thing that composed Ramshej's name in brilliant words throughout the entire existence of Marathas. Ramshej Killa, along these lines, set an example for the Maratha-Mughal war. Afterward, Ramshej post was one of the 17 fortresses given up to the British in 1818 CE.</p>
                      <br><b>History</b>
<br><p>Main article: Siege of Ramsej
Ramsej fort saw the war against Mughal Empire for six and a half years.[1] The first killedar (fort commander) was Suryaji Jadhav, but after five and a half years he was transferred and a new killedar was appointed as per the rotation of posts policy of Maratha empire. In 1682 Aurangzeb sent Sahabuddin Khan to conquer the fort. Shahbuddin Khan had vowed to capture the fort with his 40,000 army and strong artillery within a few hours. But the 600 Maratha soldiers on the fort kept his forces at bay for many months by fierce array of slingshots, lit haystack and huge stones even though they did not have cannons on the fort. Once the Mughal artillery managed to break the fort walls in the evening and they assumed that the fort will be captured easily. But all 600 Marathas on the fort worked for a full night and rebuilt the entire broken section of the wall, much to the despair and awe of the Mughals. Such fierce resistance made the Mughal soldiers believe that the Marathas on the fort knew black magic. The inability of Mughal Sardar to capture the fort started frustrating Aurangzeb. He raised a wooden platform to storm the fort. Marathas were very smart in the fact that Shivaji and his son Sambhaji had a policy of keeping enough ammunition even on the forts having no cannons or guns. Ramshej was no exception and even though it did not have cannons it had sufficient ammunition. The fort commander had an idea and utilised amply available animal skin and wood on the fort to make wooden cannons. Coupled with the ammunition already present on the fort these wooden cannons started inflicting heavy losses on mughal army. The retaliation from the Marathas was so strong that he left the responsibility to Bahadurkhan and went to Junnar. Bahadurkhan also tried to capture the fort by fooling Marathas into believing that the Mughals were preparing for a full fledged frontal assault. While his real plan was send 200 of his best troops from the rear side of the fort by climbing the steep cliff. The Maratha commander was aware of the fact and allowed these 200 soldiers to climb the rope. Once they had climbed up the rope, he cut the rope as a result of which 200 of the best mughal soldiers fell and died in the valley. Bahadurkhan was distraught and found that Marathas were receiving secret supplies from the nearby forts. He carefully blocked all the paths to nearby Maratha forts. There was dire shortage of food on the fort. Seeing this situation Maratha King Sambhaji acted quickly by sending his sardars Rupaji Bhosle and Manaji More with an 8,000 strong army and supplies. They tried to break through the Mughal line but we're unable to supply the fort. Sambhaji was in great worry that his fiercely brave warriors were fighting without food. But the luck supported the Marathas and due to severe bad weather Bahadurkhan relaxed his encirclement for one day enabling Rupaji and Manaji to supply the fort with supplies enough for 6 more months. Bahadurkhan then tried to win the fort with the help of a 'mantrik' as he believed that the Marathas had ghosts under their control. The Marathas again fooled him as the mantrik was himself a maratha soldier in disguise who led the Mughal army in a deadly ambush of the marathas. Bahadurkhan and Mughals fled the deadly ambush and several Mughals were killed in this surprise attack. Bahadurkhan was also unable to siege the fort, finally, he burnt the wooden platform and left the battle. Aurangzeb sent Kasim Khan Kirmani to lead the battle[2] and the Mughals conquered Ramshej Fort. Ramsej was one of the forts which surrendered to British Army in 1818 after the fall of Trymbakgad fort.[3] Captain Briggs describes that there were eight guns, 9 small cannons called jamburasand 21 jingals on the fort.</p>
